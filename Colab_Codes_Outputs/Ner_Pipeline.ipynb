Her Coumadin was placed on hold. A repeat echocardiogram was checked. She was started on prophylaxis for DVT with Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously. Her history dated back to March 2005 when she first sought medical attention for evidence of pericarditis, which was treated with pericardial window in an outside hospital, at that time she was also found to have mesenteric pain and thrombosis, is now anticoagulated. Her pericardial fluid was accumulated and she was seen by Dr. Y. At that time, she was recommended for pericardectomy, which was performed by Dr. Z. Review of her CT scan from March 2006 prior to her pericardectomy, already shows bilateral plural effusions. The patient improved clinically after the pericardectomy with resolution of her symptoms. Recently, she was readmitted to the hospital with chest pain and found to have bilateral pleural effusion, the right greater than the left. CT of the chest also revealed a large mediastinal lymph node. We reviewed the pathology obtained from the pericardectomy in March 2006, which was diagnostic of mesothelioma. At this time, chest tube placement for drainage of the fluid occurred and thoracoscopy with fluid biopsies, which were performed, which revealed epithelioid malignant mesothelioma. The patient was then stained with a PET CT, which showed extensive uptake in the chest, bilateral pleural pericardial effusions, and lymphadenopathy. She also had acidic fluid, pectoral and intramammary lymph nodes and uptake in L4 with SUV of 4. This was consistent with stage III disease. Her repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45% to 49%. She was transferred to Oncology service and started on chemotherapy on September 1, 2007 with cisplatin 75 mg/centimeter squared equaling 109 mg IV piggyback over 2 hours on September 1, 2007, Alimta 500 mg/ centimeter squared equaling 730 mg IV piggyback over 10 minutes. This was all initiated after a Port-A-Cath was placed. The chemotherapy was well tolerated and the patient was discharged the following day after discontinuing IV fluid and IV. Her Port-A-Cath was packed with heparin according to protocol.\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\nZofran, Phenergan, Coumadin, and Lovenox, and Vicodin\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:\\nShe was instructed to followup with Dr. XYZ in the office to check her INR on Tuesday. She was instructed to call if she had any other questions or concerns in the interim.\\nKeywords:\\nhematology - oncology, mesothelioma, pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation, anemia, ascites, esophageal reflux, deep venous thrombosis, port-a-cath placement, port a cath, iv piggyback, venous thrombosis, atrial, thrombosis, pericardial, lymphadenopathy, fluid, pericardectomy, chest, pleural,\",\n          \"Sample Type / Medical Specialty:\\nHematology - Oncology\\nSample Name:\\nMetastatic Ovarian Cancer - Consult\\nDescription:\\nA very pleasant 66-year-old woman with recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nREASON FOR CONSULTATION:\\nMetastatic ovarian cancer.\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\\nMrs. ABCD is a very nice 66-year-old woman who is followed in clinic by Dr. X for history of renal cell cancer, breast cancer, as well as ovarian cancer, which was initially diagnosed 10 years ago, but over the last several months has recurred and is now metastatic. She last saw Dr. X in clinic towards the beginning of this month. She has been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycles of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08. She was last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y. At that point, her white count was 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelets of 81,000. Her ANC was 0.5. She was started on prophylactic Augmentin as well as Neupogen shots. She has also had history of recurrent pleural effusions with the knee for thoracentesis. She had two of these performed in November and the last one was done about a week ago.\\nOver the last 2 or 3 days, she states she has been getting more short of breath. Her history is somewhat limited today as she is very tired and falls asleep readily. Her history comes from herself but also from the review of the records. Overall, her shortness of breath has been going on for the past few weeks related to her pleural effusions. She was seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray was found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which was felt to be possibly related to pneumonia. She specifically denied any fevers or chills. However, she was complaining of chest pain. She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough. When she did cough, it was nonproductive. While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations. An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes. The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate. A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe. The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism. Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT. There was apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she was started on Lovenox. There was also concern for pneumonia and she was started on Zosyn as well as vancomycin and admitted to the hospital.\\nAt this point, we have been consulted to help follow along with this patient who is well known to our clinic.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\\n1. Ovarian cancer - This was initially diagnosed about 10 years ago and treated with surgical resection including TAH and BSO.

She is married and has 3 children. She lives at home with her husband. She used to work as a unit clerk at XYZ Medical Center.\\nFAMILY HISTORY:\\nBoth her mother and father had a history of lung cancer and both were smokers.\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\\nGENERAL/CONSTITUTIONAL: She has not had any fever, chills, night sweats, but has had fatigue and weight loss of unspecified amount. HEENT: She has not had trouble with headaches; mouth, jaw, or teeth pain; change in vision; double vision; or loss of hearing or ringing in her ears. CHEST: Per the HPI, she has had some increasing dyspnea, shortness of breath with exertion, cough, but no sputum production or hemoptysis. CVS: She has had the episodes of chest pains as described above but has not had, PND, orthopnea lower extremity swelling or palpitations. GI: No heartburn, odynophagia, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, blood in her stool, and black tarry stools. GU: No dysuria, burning with urination, kidney stones, and difficulty voiding. MUSCULOSKELETAL: No new back pain, hip pain, rib pain, swollen joints, history of gout, or muscle weakness. NEUROLOGIC: She has been diffusely weak but no lateralizing loss of strength or feeling. She has some chronic neuropathic pain and numbness as described above in the past medical history. She is fatigued and tired today and falls asleep while talking but is easily arousable. Some of this is related to her lack of sleep over the admission thus far.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nVITAL SIGNS: Her T-max is 99.3. Her pulse is 54, her respirations is 12, and blood pressure 118/61.\\nGENERAL: Somewhat fatigued appearing but in no acute distress.\\nHEENT: NC/AT. Sclerae anicteric. Conjunctiva clear. Oropharynx is clear without any erythema, exudate, or discharge.\\nNECK: Supple. Nontender. No elevated JVP. No thyromegaly. No thyroid nodules.\\nCHEST: Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally with decreased breath sounds on the right.\\nCVS: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs. Normal S1 and S2. No S3 or S4.\\nABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Normoactive bowel sounds. No guarding or rebound. No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses.\\nMUSCULOSKELETAL: Generalized muscle weakness but no joint swelling or other abnormalities.\\nSKIN: No rashes, bruising, or petechia. No non-healing wounds or ulcerations.\\nNEUROLOGIC: She is oriented x3 but she falls asleep readily. On exam and conversation, her cranial nerves are intact. She has no sensory loss. Her strength is symmetric.\\nLABORATORY DATA:\\nHer white blood cell count is 8.0, hemoglobin 11.1, hematocrit 33.2%, and platelets 29,000. Her differential shows 2% metamyelocytes, 57% neutrophils, 29% bands, 6% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils. Her sodium is 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, CO2 of 23, BUN 21, creatinine 1.4, glucose 107, and calcium 8.7. Her INR is 1.0, PT of 12, and PTT 24. Urinalysis negative for nitrite and leukocyte esterase with moderate epithelial cells, bacteria, white blood cells, and yeast suggesting of contamination. Her troponins have been negative x3.\\nIMAGINING DATA:\\nCT scan of her chest on 12/25/08 shows bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right than the left but these are somewhat decreased in size compared to the prior CT scan at the end of November. There is some consolidative atelectasis at the bilateral basis. There is some peripheral interstitial opacifications noted in the right lung and to a lesser extent in the left lung possibly consistent with pneumonitis. There are small peripheral nodular densities in both lungs unchanged compared to prior scan. There is an enlarged right adrenal gland again noted without change.\\nASSESSMENT:\\nABCD is a very pleasant 66-year-old woman with recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer known to our clinic. At this point, she has been admitted for shortness of breath with possible presumed pneumonia. The possibility of a PE also remains and the plan has been to do a CTA once her kidney function improves. Currently, she is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and Lovenox prophylactically.\\nAt this point, it does not appear that her pleural effusions have increased and this would not be the etiology behind her worsening symptoms. Her blood counts appear to be recovering from chemotherapy except for the fact that her platelets have gone lower. It is unclear as to the etiology behind this but may still be related to chemotherapy effect. This also could be related to consumptive process such as DIC in the face of infections or medication effect. We will keep track of her blood counts over this admission.\\nWe will continue to follow along through the course of her admission. She has requested being full code. I went back and looked at Dr. X's chart after our clinic chart and at the last visit with Dr. X and Dr. Y, she confirmed that she wanted to be DNR/DNI. I am not sure why this is changed and I will address this issue with her once she is more alert.\\nThank you very much for this consult.\\n\",\n          \"Sample Type / Medical Specialty:\\nHematology - Oncology\\nSample Name:\\nHDR Brachytherapy\\nDescription:\\nHDR Brachytherapy\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nHDR BRACHYTHERAPY\\nThe intracavitary brachytherapy applicator was placed appropriately and secured after the patient was identified. Simulation films were obtained, documenting its positioning. The 3-dimensional treatment planning process was accomplished utilizing the CT derived data. A treatment plan was selected utilizing sequential dwell positions within a single catheter. The patient was taken to the treatment area. The patient was appropriately positioned and the position of the intracavitary device was checked. Catheter length measurements were taken. Appropriate measurements of the probe dimensions and assembly were also performed. The applicator was attached to the HDR after-loader device. The device ran through its checking sequences appropriately and the brachytherapy was then delivered without difficulty or complication. The brachytherapy source was appropriately removed back to the brachytherapy safe within the device. Radiation screening was performed with the Geiger-Muller counter both prior to and after the brachytherapy procedure was completed and the results were deemed appropriate.\\nFollowing completion of the procedure, the intracavitary device was removed without difficulty. The patient was in no apparent distress and was discharged home.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"begin\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"int32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 879,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1690,\n          1285,\n          4818\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"end\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"int32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 877,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1350,\n          543,\n          1234\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 661,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"supraclavicular\",\n          \"the special procedure\",\n          \"the right lower lid defect\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"entity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"PROBLEM\",\n          \"TREATMENT\",\n          \"TEST\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Her Coumadin was placed on hold. A repeat echocardiogram was checked. She was started on prophylaxis for DVT with Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously. Her history dated back to March 2005 when she first sought medical attention for evidence of pericarditis, which was treated with pericardial window in an outside hospital, at that time she was also found to have mesenteric pain and thrombosis, is now anticoagulated. Her pericardial fluid was accumulated and she was seen by Dr. Y. At that time, she was recommended for pericardectomy, which was performed by Dr. Z. Review of her CT scan from March 2006 prior to her pericardectomy, already shows bilateral plural effusions. The patient improved clinically after the pericardectomy with resolution of her symptoms. Recently, she was readmitted to the hospital with chest pain and found to have bilateral pleural effusion, the right greater than the left. CT of the chest also revealed a large mediastinal lymph node. We reviewed the pathology obtained from the pericardectomy in March 2006, which was diagnostic of mesothelioma. At this time, chest tube placement for drainage of the fluid occurred and thoracoscopy with fluid biopsies, which were performed, which revealed epithelioid malignant mesothelioma. The patient was then stained with a PET CT, which showed extensive uptake in the chest, bilateral pleural pericardial effusions, and lymphadenopathy. She also had acidic fluid, pectoral and intramammary lymph nodes and uptake in L4 with SUV of 4. This was consistent with stage III disease. Her repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45% to 49%. She was transferred to Oncology service and started on chemotherapy on September 1, 2007 with cisplatin 75 mg/centimeter squared equaling 109 mg IV piggyback over 2 hours on September 1, 2007, Alimta 500 mg/ centimeter squared equaling 730 mg IV piggyback over 10 minutes. This was all initiated after a Port-A-Cath was placed. The chemotherapy was well tolerated and the patient was discharged the following day after discontinuing IV fluid and IV. Her Port-A-Cath was packed with heparin according to protocol.\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\nZofran, Phenergan, Coumadin, and Lovenox, and Vicodin\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:\\nShe was instructed to followup with Dr. XYZ in the office to check her INR on Tuesday. She was instructed to call if she had any other questions or concerns in the interim.\\nKeywords:\\nhematology - oncology, mesothelioma, pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation, anemia, ascites, esophageal reflux, deep venous thrombosis, port-a-cath placement, port a cath, iv piggyback, venous thrombosis, atrial, thrombosis, pericardial, lymphadenopathy, fluid, pericardectomy, chest, pleural,\",\n          \"Sample Type / Medical Specialty:\\nHematology - Oncology\\nSample Name:\\nBCCa Excision - Lower Lid\\nDescription:\\nExcision of large basal cell carcinoma, right lower lid, and repaired with used dorsal conjunctival flap in the upper lid and a large preauricular skin graft.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\\nExtremely large basal cell carcinoma, right lower lid.\\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\\nExtremely large basal cell carcinoma, right lower lid.\\nTITLE OF OPERATION:\\nExcision of large basal cell carcinoma, right lower lid, and repaired with used dorsal conjunctival flap in the upper lid and a large preauricular skin graft.\\nPROCEDURE:\\nThe patient was brought into the operating room and prepped and draped in usual fashion. Xylocaine 2% with epinephrine was injected beneath the conjunctiva and skin of the lower lid and also beneath the conjunctiva and skin of the upper lid. A frontal nerve block was also given on the right upper lid. The anesthetic agent was also injected in the right preauricular region which would provide a donor graft for the right lower lid defect. The area was marked with a marking pen with margins of 3 to 4 mm, and a #15 Bard-Parker blade was used to make an incision at the nasal and temporal margins of the lesion.\\nThe incision was carried inferiorly, and using a Steven scissors the normal skin, muscle, and conjunctiva was excised inferiorly. The specimen was then marked and sent to pathology for frozen section. Bleeding was controlled with a wet-field cautery, and the right upper lid was everted, and an incision was made 3 mm above the lid margin with the Bard-Parker blade in the entire length of the upper lid. The incision reached the orbicularis, and Steven scissors were used to separate the tarsus from the underlying orbicularis. Vertical cuts were made nasally and temporally, and a large dorsal conjunctival flap was fashioned with the conjunctiva attached superiorly. It was placed into the defect in the lower lid and sutured with multiple interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures nasally, temporally, and inferiorly.\\nThe defect in the skin was measured and an appropriate large preauricular graft was excised from the right preauricular region. The defect was closed with interrupted 5-0 Prolene sutures, and the preauricular graft was sutured in place with multiple interrupted 6-0 silk sutures. The upper border of the graft was attached to the upper lid after incision was made in the gray line with a Superblade, and the superior portion of the skin graft was sutured to the upper lid through the anterior lamella created by the razor blade incision.\\nCryotherapy was then used to treat the nasal and temporal margins of the area of excision because of positive margins, and following this an antibiotic steroid ointment was instilled and a light pressure dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room in good condition.\\nKeywords:\\nhematology - oncology, basal cell carcinoma, cryotherapy, steven scissors, conjunctiva, conjunctival flap, frontal nerve block, frozen section, lower lid, orbicularis, skin graft, nasal and temporal margins, dorsal conjunctival flap, upper lid, basal, carcinoma, preauricular, incision, conjunctival,\",\n          \"Sample Type / Medical Specialty:\\nHematology - Oncology\\nSample Name:\\nMetastatic Ovarian Cancer - Consult\\nDescription:\\nA very pleasant 66-year-old woman with recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nREASON FOR CONSULTATION:\\nMetastatic ovarian cancer.\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\\nMrs. ABCD is a very nice 66-year-old woman who is followed in clinic by Dr. X for history of renal cell cancer, breast cancer, as well as ovarian cancer, which was initially diagnosed 10 years ago, but over the last several months has recurred and is now metastatic. She last saw Dr. X in clinic towards the beginning of this month. She has been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycles of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08. She was last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y. At that point, her white count was 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelets of 81,000. Her ANC was 0.5. She was started on prophylactic Augmentin as well as Neupogen shots. She has also had history of recurrent pleural effusions with the knee for thoracentesis. She had two of these performed in November and the last one was done about a week ago.\\nOver the last 2 or 3 days, she states she has been getting more short of breath. Her history is somewhat limited today as she is very tired and falls asleep readily. Her history comes from herself but also from the review of the records. Overall, her shortness of breath has been going on for the past few weeks related to her pleural effusions. She was seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray was found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which was felt to be possibly related to pneumonia. She specifically denied any fevers or chills. However, she was complaining of chest pain. She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough. When she did cough, it was nonproductive. While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations. An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes. The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate. A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe. The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism. Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT. There was apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she was started on Lovenox. There was also concern for pneumonia and she was started on Zosyn as well as vancomycin and admitted to the hospital.\\nAt this point, we have been consulted to help follow along with this patient who is well known to our clinic.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\\n1.

Her differential shows 2% metamyelocytes, 57% neutrophils, 29% bands, 6% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils. Her sodium is 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, CO2 of 23, BUN 21, creatinine 1.4, glucose 107, and calcium 8.7. Her INR is 1.0, PT of 12, and PTT 24. Urinalysis negative for nitrite and leukocyte esterase with moderate epithelial cells, bacteria, white blood cells, and yeast suggesting of contamination. Her troponins have been negative x3.\\nIMAGINING DATA:\\nCT scan of her chest on 12/25/08 shows bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right than the left but these are somewhat decreased in size compared to the prior CT scan at the end of November. There is some consolidative atelectasis at the bilateral basis. There is some peripheral interstitial opacifications noted in the right lung and to a lesser extent in the left lung possibly consistent with pneumonitis. There are small peripheral nodular densities in both lungs unchanged compared to prior scan. There is an enlarged right adrenal gland again noted without change.\\nASSESSMENT:\\nABCD is a very pleasant 66-year-old woman with recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer known to our clinic. At this point, she has been admitted for shortness of breath with possible presumed pneumonia. The possibility of a PE also remains and the plan has been to do a CTA once her kidney function improves. Currently, she is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and Lovenox prophylactically.\\nAt this point, it does not appear that her pleural effusions have increased and this would not be the etiology behind her worsening symptoms. Her blood counts appear to be recovering from chemotherapy except for the fact that her platelets have gone lower. It is unclear as to the etiology behind this but may still be related to chemotherapy effect. This also could be related to consumptive process such as DIC in the face of infections or medication effect. We will keep track of her blood counts over this admission.\\nWe will continue to follow along through the course of her admission. She has requested being full code. I went back and looked at Dr. X's chart after our clinic chart and at the last visit with Dr. X and Dr. Y, she confirmed that she wanted to be DNR/DNI. I am not sure why this is changed and I will address this issue with her once she is more alert.\\nThank you very much for this consult.\\nKeywords:\\nhematology - oncology, renal cell cancer, breast cancer, metastatic ovarian cancer, shortness of breath, pleural effusions, cancer, ovarian, recurrent,\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"begin\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"int32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 260,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1466,\n          10418,\n          14590\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"end\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"int32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 259,\n        \"samples\": [\n          589,\n          2126,\n          4635\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 57,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Coumadin\",\n          \"piggyback\",\n          \"carboplatin\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"entity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DOSAGE\",\n          \"DRUG\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The treatment planning process requires at least 4 hours of physician time. The technology is appropriate in this patient's case due to the fact that the target volume is adjacent to significant radiosensitive structures. Sequential CT scans are obtained and transferred to the treatment planning software. Extensive analysis occurs. The target volumes, including margins for uncertainty, patient movement and occult tumor extension are selected. In addition, organs at risk are outlined. Doses are selected both for targets, as well as for organs at risk. Associated dose constraints are placed. Inverse treatment planning is then performed in conjunction with the physics staff. These are reviewed by the physician and ultimately performed only following approval by the physician. Multiple beam arrangements may be tested for appropriateness and optimal dose delivery in order to maximize the chance of controlling disease, while minimizing exposure to organs at risk. This is performed in hopes of minimizing associated complications. The physician delineates the treatment type, number of fractions and total volume. During the time of treatment, there is extensive physician intervention, monitoring the patient set up and tolerance. In addition, specific QA is performed by the physics staff under the physician's direction.\\nIn view of the above, the special procedure code 77470 is deemed appropriate.\\n\",\n          \"Sample Type / Medical Specialty:\\nHematology - Oncology\\nSample Name:\\nMetastatic Ovarian Cancer - Consult\\nDescription:\\nA very pleasant 66-year-old woman with recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nREASON FOR CONSULTATION:\\nMetastatic ovarian cancer.\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\\nMrs. ABCD is a very nice 66-year-old woman who is followed in clinic by Dr. X for history of renal cell cancer, breast cancer, as well as ovarian cancer, which was initially diagnosed 10 years ago, but over the last several months has recurred and is now metastatic. She last saw Dr. X in clinic towards the beginning of this month. She has been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycles of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08. She was last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y. At that point, her white count was 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelets of 81,000. Her ANC was 0.5. She was started on prophylactic Augmentin as well as Neupogen shots. She has also had history of recurrent pleural effusions with the knee for thoracentesis. She had two of these performed in November and the last one was done about a week ago.\\nOver the last 2 or 3 days, she states she has been getting more short of breath. Her history is somewhat limited today as she is very tired and falls asleep readily. Her history comes from herself but also from the review of the records. Overall, her shortness of breath has been going on for the past few weeks related to her pleural effusions. She was seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray was found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which was felt to be possibly related to pneumonia. She specifically denied any fevers or chills. However, she was complaining of chest pain. She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough. When she did cough, it was nonproductive. While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations. An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes. The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate. A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe. The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism. Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT. There was apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she was started on Lovenox. There was also concern for pneumonia and she was started on Zosyn as well as vancomycin and admitted to the hospital.\\nAt this point, we have been consulted to help follow along with this patient who is well known to our clinic.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\\n1.

HEENT: She has not had trouble with headaches; mouth, jaw, or teeth pain; change in vision; double vision; or loss of hearing or ringing in her ears. CHEST: Per the HPI, she has had some increasing dyspnea, shortness of breath with exertion, cough, but no sputum production or hemoptysis.

NEUROLOGIC: She has been diffusely weak but no lateralizing loss of strength or feeling. She has some chronic neuropathic pain and numbness as described above in the past medical history. She is fatigued and tired today and falls asleep while talking but is easily arousable. Some of this is related to her lack of sleep over the admission thus far.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nVITAL SIGNS: Her T-max is 99.3. Her pulse is 54, her respirations is 12, and blood pressure 118/61.\\nGENERAL: Somewhat fatigued appearing but in no acute distress.\\nHEENT: NC/AT. Sclerae anicteric. Conjunctiva clear. Oropharynx is clear without any erythema, exudate, or discharge.\\nNECK: Supple. Nontender. No elevated JVP. No thyromegaly. No thyroid nodules.\\nCHEST: Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally with decreased breath sounds on the right.\\nCVS: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs. Normal S1 and S2. No S3 or S4.\\nABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Normoactive bowel sounds. No guarding or rebound. No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses.\\nMUSCULOSKELETAL: Generalized muscle weakness but no joint swelling or other abnormalities.\\nSKIN: No rashes, bruising, or petechia. No non-healing wounds or ulcerations.\\nNEUROLOGIC: She is oriented x3 but she falls asleep readily. On exam and conversation, her cranial nerves are intact. She has no sensory loss. Her strength is symmetric.\\nLABORATORY DATA:\\nHer white blood cell count is 8.0, hemoglobin 11.1, hematocrit 33.2%, and platelets 29,000. Her differential shows 2% metamyelocytes, 57% neutrophils, 29% bands, 6% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils. Her sodium is 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, CO2 of 23, BUN 21, creatinine 1.4, glucose 107, and calcium 8.7. Her INR is 1.0, PT of 12, and PTT 24. Urinalysis negative for nitrite and leukocyte esterase with moderate epithelial cells, bacteria, white blood cells, and yeast suggesting of contamination. Her troponins have been negative x3.\\nIMAGINING DATA:\\nCT scan of her chest on 12/25/08 shows bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right than the left but these are somewhat decreased in size compared to the prior CT scan at the end of November. There is some consolidative atelectasis at the bilateral basis. There is some peripheral interstitial opacifications noted in the right lung and to a lesser extent in the left lung possibly consistent with pneumonitis. There are small peripheral nodular densities in both lungs unchanged compared to prior scan. There is an enlarged right adrenal gland again noted without change.\\nASSESSMENT:\\nABCD is a very pleasant 66-year-old woman with recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer known to our clinic. At this point, she has been admitted for shortness of breath with possible presumed pneumonia. The possibility of a PE also remains and the plan has been to do a CTA once her kidney function improves. Currently, she is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and Lovenox prophylactically.\\nAt this point, it does not appear that her pleural effusions have increased and this would not be the etiology behind her worsening symptoms. Her blood counts appear to be recovering from chemotherapy except for the fact that her platelets have gone lower. It is unclear as to the etiology behind this but may still be related to chemotherapy effect. This also could be related to consumptive process such as DIC in the face of infections or medication effect. We will keep track of her blood counts over this admission.\\nWe will continue to follow along through the course of her admission. She has requested being full code. I went back and looked at Dr. X's chart after our clinic chart and at the last visit with Dr. X and Dr. Y, she confirmed that she wanted to be DNR/DNI. I am not sure why this is changed and I will address this issue with her once she is more alert.\\nThank you very much for this consult.\\n\",\n          \"Sample Type / Medical Specialty:\\nHematology - Oncology\\nSample Name:\\nDischarge Summary - Mesothelioma - 1\\nDescription:\\nMesothelioma, pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation, anemia, ascites, esophageal reflux, and history of deep venous thrombosis.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:\\nMesothelioma.\\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSES:\\nPleural effusion, atrial fibrillation, anemia, ascites, esophageal reflux, and history of deep venous thrombosis.\\nPROCEDURES\\n1.

Her Coumadin was placed on hold. A repeat echocardiogram was checked. She was started on prophylaxis for DVT with Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously. Her history dated back to March 2005 when she first sought medical attention for evidence of pericarditis, which was treated with pericardial window in an outside hospital, at that time she was also found to have mesenteric pain and thrombosis, is now anticoagulated. Her pericardial fluid was accumulated and she was seen by Dr. Y. At that time, she was recommended for pericardectomy, which was performed by Dr. Z. Review of her CT scan from March 2006 prior to her pericardectomy, already shows bilateral plural effusions. The patient improved clinically after the pericardectomy with resolution of her symptoms. Recently, she was readmitted to the hospital with chest pain and found to have bilateral pleural effusion, the right greater than the left. CT of the chest also revealed a large mediastinal lymph node. We reviewed the pathology obtained from the pericardectomy in March 2006, which was diagnostic of mesothelioma. At this time, chest tube placement for drainage of the fluid occurred and thoracoscopy with fluid biopsies, which were performed, which revealed epithelioid malignant mesothelioma. The patient was then stained with a PET CT, which showed extensive uptake in the chest, bilateral pleural pericardial effusions, and lymphadenopathy. She also had acidic fluid, pectoral and intramammary lymph nodes and uptake in L4 with SUV of 4. This was consistent with stage III disease. Her repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45% to 49%. She was transferred to Oncology service and started on chemotherapy on September 1, 2007 with cisplatin 75 mg/centimeter squared equaling 109 mg IV piggyback over 2 hours on September 1, 2007, Alimta 500 mg/ centimeter squared equaling 730 mg IV piggyback over 10 minutes. This was all initiated after a Port-A-Cath was placed. The chemotherapy was well tolerated and the patient was discharged the following day after discontinuing IV fluid and IV. Her Port-A-Cath was packed with heparin according to protocol.\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\nZofran, Phenergan, Coumadin, and Lovenox, and Vicodin\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:\\nShe was instructed to followup with Dr. XYZ in the office to check her INR on Tuesday. She was instructed to call if she had any other questions or concerns in the interim.\\nKeywords:\\nhematology - oncology, mesothelioma, pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation, anemia, ascites, esophageal reflux, deep venous thrombosis, port-a-cath placement, port a cath, iv piggyback, venous thrombosis, atrial, thrombosis, pericardial, lymphadenopathy, fluid, pericardectomy, chest, pleural,\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"begin\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"int32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 526,\n        \"samples\": [\n          10214,\n          13381,\n          1507\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"end\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"int32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 527,\n        \"samples\": [\n          10223,\n          13228,\n          1520\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 39,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"01/07/2024\",\n          \"02/07/2024\",\n          \"Vietnamese\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"entity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DATE\",\n          \"AGE\",\n          \"PROFESSION\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Her Coumadin was placed on hold. A repeat echocardiogram was checked. She was started on prophylaxis for DVT with Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously. Her history dated back to March 2005 when she first sought medical attention for evidence of pericarditis, which was treated with pericardial window in an outside hospital, at that time she was also found to have mesenteric pain and thrombosis, is now anticoagulated. Her pericardial fluid was accumulated and she was seen by Dr. Y. At that time, she was recommended for pericardectomy, which was performed by Dr. Z. Review of her CT scan from March 2006 prior to her pericardectomy, already shows bilateral plural effusions. The patient improved clinically after the pericardectomy with resolution of her symptoms. Recently, she was readmitted to the hospital with chest pain and found to have bilateral pleural effusion, the right greater than the left. CT of the chest also revealed a large mediastinal lymph node. We reviewed the pathology obtained from the pericardectomy in March 2006, which was diagnostic of mesothelioma. At this time, chest tube placement for drainage of the fluid occurred and thoracoscopy with fluid biopsies, which were performed, which revealed epithelioid malignant mesothelioma. The patient was then stained with a PET CT, which showed extensive uptake in the chest, bilateral pleural pericardial effusions, and lymphadenopathy. She also had acidic fluid, pectoral and intramammary lymph nodes and uptake in L4 with SUV of 4. This was consistent with stage III disease. Her repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45% to 49%. She was transferred to Oncology service and started on chemotherapy on September 1, 2007 with cisplatin 75 mg/centimeter squared equaling 109 mg IV piggyback over 2 hours on September 1, 2007, Alimta 500 mg/ centimeter squared equaling 730 mg IV piggyback over 10 minutes. This was all initiated after a Port-A-Cath was placed. The chemotherapy was well tolerated and the patient was discharged the following day after discontinuing IV fluid and IV. Her Port-A-Cath was packed with heparin according to protocol.\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\nZofran, Phenergan, Coumadin, and Lovenox, and Vicodin\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:\\nShe was instructed to followup with Dr. XYZ in the office to check her INR on Tuesday. She was instructed to call if she had any other questions or concerns in the interim.\\nKeywords:\\nhematology - oncology, mesothelioma, pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation, anemia, ascites, esophageal reflux, deep venous thrombosis, port-a-cath placement, port a cath, iv piggyback, venous thrombosis, atrial, thrombosis, pericardial, lymphadenopathy, fluid, pericardectomy, chest, pleural,\",\n          \"Sample Type / Medical Specialty:\\nHematology - Oncology\\nSample Name:\\nMetastatic Ovarian Cancer - Consult\\nDescription:\\nA very pleasant 66-year-old woman with recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nREASON FOR CONSULTATION:\\nMetastatic ovarian cancer.\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\\nMrs. ABCD is a very nice 66-year-old woman who is followed in clinic by Dr. X for history of renal cell cancer, breast cancer, as well as ovarian cancer, which was initially diagnosed 10 years ago, but over the last several months has recurred and is now metastatic. She last saw Dr. X in clinic towards the beginning of this month. She has been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycles of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08. She was last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y. At that point, her white count was 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelets of 81,000. Her ANC was 0.5. She was started on prophylactic Augmentin as well as Neupogen shots. She has also had history of recurrent pleural effusions with the knee for thoracentesis. She had two of these performed in November and the last one was done about a week ago.\\nOver the last 2 or 3 days, she states she has been getting more short of breath. Her history is somewhat limited today as she is very tired and falls asleep readily. Her history comes from herself but also from the review of the records. Overall, her shortness of breath has been going on for the past few weeks related to her pleural effusions. She was seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray was found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which was felt to be possibly related to pneumonia. She specifically denied any fevers or chills. However, she was complaining of chest pain. She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough. When she did cough, it was nonproductive. While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations. An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes. The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate. A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe. The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism. Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT. There was apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she was started on Lovenox. There was also concern for pneumonia and she was started on Zosyn as well as vancomycin and admitted to the hospital.\\nAt this point, we have been consulted to help follow along with this patient who is well known to our clinic.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\\n1. Ovarian cancer - This was initially diagnosed about 10 years ago and treated with surgical resection including TAH and BSO.

She is married and has 3 children. She lives at home with her husband. She used to work as a unit clerk at XYZ Medical Center.\\nFAMILY HISTORY:\\nBoth her mother and father had a history of lung cancer and both were smokers.\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\\nGENERAL/CONSTITUTIONAL: She has not had any fever, chills, night sweats, but has had fatigue and weight loss of unspecified amount. HEENT: She has not had trouble with headaches; mouth, jaw, or teeth pain; change in vision; double vision; or loss of hearing or ringing in her ears. CHEST: Per the HPI, she has had some increasing dyspnea, shortness of breath with exertion, cough, but no sputum production or hemoptysis. CVS: She has had the episodes of chest pains as described above but has not had, PND, orthopnea lower extremity swelling or palpitations. GI: No heartburn, odynophagia, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, blood in her stool, and black tarry stools. GU: No dysuria, burning with urination, kidney stones, and difficulty voiding. MUSCULOSKELETAL: No new back pain, hip pain, rib pain, swollen joints, history of gout, or muscle weakness. NEUROLOGIC: She has been diffusely weak but no lateralizing loss of strength or feeling. She has some chronic neuropathic pain and numbness as described above in the past medical history. She is fatigued and tired today and falls asleep while talking but is easily arousable. Some of this is related to her lack of sleep over the admission thus far.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nVITAL SIGNS: Her T-max is 99.3. Her pulse is 54, her respirations is 12, and blood pressure 118/61.\\nGENERAL: Somewhat fatigued appearing but in no acute distress.\\nHEENT: NC/AT. Sclerae anicteric. Conjunctiva clear. Oropharynx is clear without any erythema, exudate, or discharge.\\nNECK: Supple. Nontender. No elevated JVP. No thyromegaly. No thyroid nodules.\\nCHEST: Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally with decreased breath sounds on the right.\\nCVS: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs. Normal S1 and S2. No S3 or S4.\\nABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Normoactive bowel sounds. No guarding or rebound. No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses.\\nMUSCULOSKELETAL: Generalized muscle weakness but no joint swelling or other abnormalities.\\nSKIN: No rashes, bruising, or petechia. No non-healing wounds or ulcerations.\\nNEUROLOGIC: She is oriented x3 but she falls asleep readily. On exam and conversation, her cranial nerves are intact. She has no sensory loss. Her strength is symmetric.\\nLABORATORY DATA:\\nHer white blood cell count is 8.0, hemoglobin 11.1, hematocrit 33.2%, and platelets 29,000. Her differential shows 2% metamyelocytes, 57% neutrophils, 29% bands, 6% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils. Her sodium is 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, CO2 of 23, BUN 21, creatinine 1.4, glucose 107, and calcium 8.7. Her INR is 1.0, PT of 12, and PTT 24. Urinalysis negative for nitrite and leukocyte esterase with moderate epithelial cells, bacteria, white blood cells, and yeast suggesting of contamination. Her troponins have been negative x3.\\nIMAGINING DATA:\\nCT scan of her chest on 12/25/08 shows bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right than the left but these are somewhat decreased in size compared to the prior CT scan at the end of November. There is some consolidative atelectasis at the bilateral basis. There is some peripheral interstitial opacifications noted in the right lung and to a lesser extent in the left lung possibly consistent with pneumonitis. There are small peripheral nodular densities in both lungs unchanged compared to prior scan. There is an enlarged right adrenal gland again noted without change.\\nASSESSMENT:\\nABCD is a very pleasant 66-year-old woman with recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer known to our clinic. At this point, she has been admitted for shortness of breath with possible presumed pneumonia. The possibility of a PE also remains and the plan has been to do a CTA once her kidney function improves. Currently, she is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and Lovenox prophylactically.\\nAt this point, it does not appear that her pleural effusions have increased and this would not be the etiology behind her worsening symptoms. Her blood counts appear to be recovering from chemotherapy except for the fact that her platelets have gone lower. It is unclear as to the etiology behind this but may still be related to chemotherapy effect. This also could be related to consumptive process such as DIC in the face of infections or medication effect. We will keep track of her blood counts over this admission.\\nWe will continue to follow along through the course of her admission. She has requested being full code. I went back and looked at Dr. X's chart after our clinic chart and at the last visit with Dr. X and Dr. Y, she confirmed that she wanted to be DNR/DNI. I am not sure why this is changed and I will address this issue with her once she is more alert.\\nThank you very much for this consult.\\n\",\n          \"Sample Type / Medical Specialty:\\nHematology - Oncology\\nSample Name:\\nHDR Brachytherapy\\nDescription:\\nHDR Brachytherapy\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nHDR BRACHYTHERAPY\\nThe intracavitary brachytherapy applicator was placed appropriately and secured after the patient was identified. Simulation films were obtained, documenting its positioning. The 3-dimensional treatment planning process was accomplished utilizing the CT derived data. A treatment plan was selected utilizing sequential dwell positions within a single catheter. The patient was taken to the treatment area. The patient was appropriately positioned and the position of the intracavitary device was checked. Catheter length measurements were taken. Appropriate measurements of the probe dimensions and assembly were also performed. The applicator was attached to the HDR after-loader device. The device ran through its checking sequences appropriately and the brachytherapy was then delivered without difficulty or complication. The brachytherapy source was appropriately removed back to the brachytherapy safe within the device. Radiation screening was performed with the Geiger-Muller counter both prior to and after the brachytherapy procedure was completed and the results were deemed appropriate.\\nFollowing completion of the procedure, the intracavitary device was removed without difficulty. The patient was in no apparent distress and was discharged home.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
